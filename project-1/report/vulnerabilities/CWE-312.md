    <h1>CWE-312</h1>
    <i>
        Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
    </i>
</div>

<br>

## Description

Sensitive information is stored in the database without encryption. This information can be read by anyone with access to the database or if it is compromised (e.g. by a [SQL injection attack](CWE-89.md)).

<br>

## Exploit

As previously mentioned, it is possible to access information within a database through [SQL injection](CWE-89.md). To demonstrate this, we can take a look at what we would see if we were to perform this attack on the database containing the test results, accessed through a code.

After the attack, the codes would be exposed to the attacker with **no encryption** whatsoever, meaning that they would be displayed plainly and ready to be used.

<br>

## Consequences

After the attacker manages to get the codes, it is possible for them to access the test results of each patient, which also means that they can now **read personal information** about each person. Since there is access to each file, every piece of information presented in the PDF is exposed.

It only takes access to the database and unprotected information to potentially expose a broad range of data to the attacker.

<br>

## Mitigation

The codes are stored plainly in the database, so the objective is to have some sort of protection when storing them. To achieve this, the information is hashed before it is put in the database. This means that even if there is a breach, the codes **are not displayed with their exact form**.

So, what happens when the user introduces the code in the search box?

In order to compare the input with the code in the database, we need to **hash said input**, just like we did with the codes, prior to their storage. Otherwise we will not get a match and no information will be returned. To calculate the hash, we resort to the following function:

```python
def calculate_hash(block):
    block = block.encode('utf-8')
    digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
    digest.update(block)
    return digest.finalize()
```

> With `block` being the argument, in this case, the code inserted by the user.

Then, in SQLite, the query is executed as follows:

```sql
c.execute("SELECT * FROM site_test_results WHERE code = ?", (calculate_hash(code),))
```

Now, even if the attacker manages to get access to the codes, they will not be presented in a readable way.
